History of Javascript

In 1995 there was a very popular webbrowser called Netscape Navigator. Then some people realised that they need some kind of programming language that is also easy and through which web pages can be made interactive. Brendan Eich was working for Netscape Navigator and he made JS in 1995 within just 10days. First Name that was given to JS was Mocha and then after sometimes they changed the name from Mocha to LiveScript. Livscript was not getting popular and at that time JAVA was a very popular language so as to increase the popularity of LiveScript they named it Java script. But Java and Javascript are completely different language. Internet Explorer was also very famous at that time and in 1996 it realised that Netscape Navigator is getting very popular becz of JS so they decided to do something.They copied some features of Js and implemented some feature of their own and made a new language called Jscript. So In 1996 we had two programming language one was Java Script and other was JScript but here there was problem for normal users and the problem was that if we use Javascript then our webpage will look good in Netscape Navigator and if we use Jscript then our webpage will look good in Internet Explorer.


Then Javascript was taken to Ecma. Ecma is a international organization which standardize different technologies. So they provided a standard that any webpage that runs on browser have to follow this standard. So that the same Script can run on different browser and user don't have to write the script for all the browsers.

In 1997 ES1 came in exsistence in Ecmmascript 1. And in the same way ES2,ES3,Es4 came into existence. Then came ES5 came in 2009 and a lot of new features came in ES5 and People start liking this so much and they started using this language mostly. 

In 2015 ES6 came into existence and in this there was biggest update in the history of javasript . This Javascript is also termed and mordern javascript. ecma has a community named TC 39 ie technical Community 39 and people of this community decide which new feature will come in javscript and which will not be there in javascript. they decided after ES5 that they will annualy release new fetures in JS that why after 2015 the Name of Javascript starts to change by the year in which the new feature was launched that is ES6 as ES2015, ES7 as ES2016 and so on. 


Javascipt is Backward compatible that means that the featues that came 20years back are still supported Javascript. But javascript is not forward Compatible that means New modern Javascript feature can't run on old browsers. So to overcome this forward compatibility we have a tool called Babel which is used to convert modern javascript into older javascript which is supported by old browsers as well.
